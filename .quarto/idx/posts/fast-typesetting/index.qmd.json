The key to making notes like is the use of $\\LaTeX$ snippets for fast typesetting, which I explain how to use in the rest of this post.](example-note.png){width=80% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n**The Solution**\n\nIn 2019, the late [Gilles Castel](https://castel.dev/) published an excellent blog post about taking notes using $\\LaTeX$ and Vim. Instead of typing the commands by hand, he used a snippet program to autocomplete them as he typed. If you're familiar with configuring Vim and want to try this, the original article is [here](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/). A more detailed guide, written by Elijian Mastnak, can be found [here](https://www.ejmastnak.com/tutorials/vim-latex/intro/).\n\nHowever, learning Vim and managing a bunch of dotfiles can be exhausting. For the less technically inclined, there's the [Obsidian LaTeX Suite](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite), which provides snippet functionality within Obsidian. It can be installed using the following steps:\n\n1. Open the settings menu in Obsidian\n2. Go to the community plugins tab and make sure that \"Restricted Mode\" is off.\n3. Click \"Browse\", then search for, install, and enable the Obsidian $\\LaTeX$ Suite.\n\nTo check that it was installed correctly, open a new note and type `mk`. If the text is automatically replaced with `$$`, then the plugin is working.\n\n**Writing Snippets**\n\nFor a more thorough introduction to writing snippets, I recommend you read the [documentation](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite). To create and remove snippets, open the Obsidian settings menu, then click on the \"$\\LaTeX$ Suite\" tab under \"Community Plugins\". In this, tab you should see a list of snippets that looks like this:\n\n```\n{trigger: \"...\", replacement: \"...\", options: \"...\"}\n```\n\n `trigger` is the series of keystrokes that will activate the snippet. The snippets are smart--autocomplete will replace the longest active snippet. As an example, suppose you had two snippets with triggers `psb` and `sb`. If you were to type in `psb`, the autocomplete will recognize this as the first snippet and replace it properly, ignoring the fact that the `sb` snippet is also defined. This is useful because it allows for *some* overlap in your snippets. But be careful, if the two snippets were `sb` and `sbp`, the second snippet would never activate.\n\n`replacement` is the text that will be substituted in place of the trigger. If you're writing $\\LaTeX$, remember to escape backslashes by writing `\\\\` instead of `\\`. You can also add a line break with `\\n`. The replacement can contain any number of tab stops, which are included using the characters `$0`, `$1`, etc. Upon snippet activation, the cursor will be moved to the first tab stop.\n\n`options` is a string of characters that contains the settings:\n\n- `m` stands for \"math mode\". If this setting is enabled, the snippet will only activate in math mode (both inline and display).\n- `A` stands for \"autocomplete\". If this setting is enabled, the trigger will be replaced immediately. Otherwise, you will have to press `TAB` in order to activate the snippet.\n\nAs an example, here is a simple snippet that replaces `ff` with `\\frac` command:\n\n```\n{\n    trigger: \"ff\",\n    replacement: \"\\\\frac{$0}{$1}\",\n    options: \"mA\"\n}\n```\n\n- Note that we use escape the backslash character using `\\\\`.\n- Upon snippet activation, the cursor will move to the `$0` tab stop. If you press tab again, it will move to the `$1` tab stop.\n- `\"mA\"` means the snippet will activate automatically in math mode.\n\n**Building a System**\n\nNow, go to back to the settings menu, and *delete all the default snippets*. If you want to remember your snippets and build a system that works for you, I would *highly recommend* writing them yourself. Of course, feel free to check the default snippets for ideas, many of them are very good. Here is some general advice on writing snippets:\n\n- Every snippet should autocomplete using the `\"A\"` option.\n- Snippets should be 2 or 3 characters long, 4 at the most.\n- Snippets should not use groups of letters that are commonly used in mathematical expressions. For example, an autocompleting snippet with the trigger `dx` will frequently activate when you don't want it to.\n- Use capital letters and special characters to differentiate snippets. That being said, you should try to keep your snippets as fast as possible. Using inaccessible keys like `|` or `~` in your snippets will slow you down.\n- Only create snippets when you need them. Remember that every additional snippet creates more possibilities for errors.\n\n**My Snippets**\n\nAs I mentioned above, I highly recommend creating your own snippets. That being said, I will begrudgingly share what I've been using below to you get started.\n\nEnvironments:\n\n```\n{\n\ttrigger: \"cases\", \n\treplacement: \"\\\\begin{cases}\\n$0\\n\\\\end{cases}\",
