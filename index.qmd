Hi there! I'm Riley, a third year undergraduate student pursuing a mathematics degree at the University of British Columbia. In addition to my studies, I'm interested in running, philosophy, Unix, Vim, and building efficient systems for thinking and writing. I also have a [blog](blog.qmd) where I write about note-taking methods, study strategies and my projects.

I recently finished two semesters of research with [Dr. Eric Cytrynbaum](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~cytryn/index.shtml) where we developed a mathematical model of root growth in *A. Thaliana*. An up-to-date copy of the draft can be found [here](https://github.com/rileywheadon/root-modelling/blob/master/paper/main.pdf) and the code for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/rileywheadon/clasp-model).

My email is [rileywheadon@gmail.com](mailto:rileywheadon@gmail.com). Please don't be afraid to reach out! All opinions are my own and are not representative of any groups I may be affiliated with.
