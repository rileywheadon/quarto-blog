Hi there! I'm Riley, a third year undergraduate student pursuing a mathematics degree at the University of British Columbia. In addition to my studies, I'm interested in philosophy, technology, and building efficient systems for thinking and writing. I also write a [blog](blog.qmd) which contains both personal essays and original research.  

I am currently working with Professor [Eric Cytrynbaum](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~cytryn/index.shtml) on modelling root growth in *A. Thaliana* as the receipient of a [NSERC USRA](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/UG-PC/USRA-BRPC_eng.asp). Our research explores how the [CLASP1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLASP1) protein influences the formation of stable zones of cell behaviour within the growing root. This work has proven to be highly interdisciplinary, involving concepts from cell biology, computational mathematics, and numerical methods.

My email is [rileywheadon@gmail.com](mailto:rileywheadon@gmail.com). Please don't be afraid to reach out! Obviously, all opinions expressed are my own and are not representative of any groups I may be affiliated with.
